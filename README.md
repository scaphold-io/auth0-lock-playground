#Scaphold.io's Auth0 Lock Playground

Fork this boilerplate code to get started with social authentication using Auth0 Lock.

Quickstart:

1) Update *index.html* in the three commented locations to update your Auth0 credentials and Scaphold URL.

2) Run the app with a local server (make sure to include the URL or your test server in Auth0's approved callback domains).

3) Login using the *Login* button. This will trigger the Auth0 Lock client SDK.

4) Click the *Verify* button to check and see that Auth0 Lock logged in successfully.

5) Finally, log into Scaphold with your Auth0 Lock credentials with the *Scaphold Login* button.

Congratulations! You've set up social authentication with Auth0 Lock!
